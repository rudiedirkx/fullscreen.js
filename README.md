# fullscreen.js

On a website with a cool HTML 5 video, but the fuckers didn't
make a fullscreen option? I hate that!

No more.

Add this bookmarklet and turn every HTML 5 video into fullscreen.

Not using Chrome 15+? SUCKS!

## Known issues

* For some reason the `video.webkitExitFullScreen()` doesn't work.
  Don't know why, but for now it's commented out. Chrome 15+ has
  a native ESC escape from fullscreen video, so it's not really
  necessary anyway.
